//! What is playing, at what tempo, where in the bar — and who is master.
//!
//! Two ports answer that question and neither answers all of it.
//!
//! **UDP 50001** is broadcast. Beat packets arrive *on* the beat, so a passive
//! listener that has announced nothing still sees every playing deck's tempo,
//! its pitch fader and its position in the bar. [`Monitor::start`] is that, and
//! it transmits nothing.
//!
//! **UDP 50002** is unicast to peers that have announced themselves and to
//! nobody else (F21). It carries the loaded track, the play state and — at byte
//! `0x9e` — **who holds tempo master**, which is published there and nowhere
//! else. A device that never announces can therefore never know who the master
//! is, however long it listens. [`Monitor::with_status`] takes a
//! [`VirtualCdj`] by reference for exactly that reason: the requirement is in
//! the signature rather than in a comment somebody has to read.
//!
//! # Interpolating phase
//!
//! A beat packet is an event, not a report: its arrival *is* the deck saying "I
//! am starting a beat now". So phase is `elapsed_since_the_packet /
//! beat_interval`, clamped rather than wrapped, and re-anchored by the next
//! arrival. The interval comes from the **effective** tempo — the track's BPM
//! with the pitch fader applied — because the packet's own millisecond fields
//! are quoted as if the fader were centred (see [`prolink_proto::beat`]).
//!
//! Clamped, not wrapped, because a deck that has stopped should sit at the end
//! of its beat rather than spin: a wrapped estimate looks alive, and looking
//! alive is the one thing a stopped deck must not do.
//!
//! After [`BEAT_STALE_AFTER`] — three beats at 60 BPM, and seven at 145 — the
//! phase is not merely old, it is meaningless, and [`BeatObservation::beat_phase`]
//! returns `None`. The last tempo is still readable, because "it was playing at
//! 128 and stopped" is more useful than an empty row.
//!
//! Silence is evidence, but only about a CDJ. A nexus deck sends beat packets
//! only while playing and only for a rekordbox-analysed track: in this
//! project's corpus not one status packet reporting "nothing loaded" had a beat
//! from the same deck in the preceding second. A **mixer** sends them
//! continuously as a backup metronome, so no such inference holds for one.
//!
//! # One socket per port, and who else wants them
//!
//! [`Monitor::with_status`] binds UDP 50002, and a [`VirtualCdj`] built with
//! `emit_status` set binds it too, to answer media queries. Both sockets set
//! `SO_REUSEPORT`, so both binds succeed — but a **unicast** datagram is
//! delivered to only one of them: macOS gives it to the socket bound first,
//! Linux hashes. So a monitor and a serving virtual CDJ cannot both read status.
//!
//! That is not the constraint it looks like. What makes peers unicast their
//! status to us is the *keep-alive*, not our own status stream, so a virtual CDJ
//! configured with `emit_status: false` announces, receives everything, and
//! leaves 50002 free for the monitor. Emitting status is needed only to be
//! browsed. `prolink status --announce` does exactly that.
