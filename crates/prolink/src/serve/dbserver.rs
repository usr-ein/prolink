//! The dbserver **server**: what makes a local rekordbox medium browsable from
//! a real CDJ's LINK screen.
//!
//! Every reference project in this space is a *consumer* — grepping all seven
//! for a TCP listener turns up an OBS overlay and an HTTP API, and nothing that
//! answers a dbserver query. So the shapes here were settled by replaying real
//! deck-to-deck sessions out of the capture corpus and matching what the other
//! deck sent, request type by request type.
//!
//! Two listeners, mirroring a real player:
//!
//! - **TCP [`PORT_QUERY_PORT`]**, answering the fixed nineteen-byte query with
//!   the port our dbserver is actually on. The port is nominally dynamic, which
//!   is what that port exists to say; both reference captures answer
//!   [`PORT`], and so do we when we can bind it.
//! - **the dbserver port**, one task per connection, holding that connection's
//!   menu state — because the protocol *is* stateful. A menu request
//!   establishes a result set and the `0x3000` render that follows pages
//!   through it.
//!
//! # Menus are keyed on `(descriptor, item count)`, not the count alone
//!
//! A deck does not browse one menu at a time. It dips into a metadata menu for
//! the highlighted track and then resumes a 692-item list at the next offset
//! **without re-issuing the menu request**, so several result sets have to be
//! held at once. Keying on the count alone worked until a metadata reply became
//! thirteen items and collided with a thirteen-track album, at which point
//! browsing that album served metadata for every page (F27, then F41). The
//! descriptor supplies the missing bit: its menu-target byte separates the list
//! being scrolled (`M=1`) from the transient menu dipped into (`M=2`), and it
//! is present in both the menu request and the render.
//!
//! The table is bounded — see [`MAX_PENDING_MENUS`] — because a connection that
//! never forgets a result set is a connection that grows for as long as a DJ
//! browses.
//!
//! # `0x0001` draws no reply at all, and must not discard state
//!
//! "Done with that menu, release it" is the natural reading of `MENU_CLOSE` and
//! acting on it is a bug: a deck sends it *while still scrolling* the list it is
//! supposedly finished with, so honouring it destroys the result set mid-scroll
//! (F16, F27). Reply with nothing, discard nothing.
//!
//! # The medium is resolved per message, never per connection
//!
//! A player browsing two media on the same peer opens **one** dbserver
//! connection and tells them apart purely by the descriptor's slot byte (F37).
//! Caching the medium on the connection serves the wrong library the moment the
//! DJ switches slots.
//!
//! # Never answer an unknown request with an error
//!
//! Answering `0x3e03` with `0x4003` made a deck fetch our root menu, render
//! every category, and then disconnect without opening one of them (F25). An
//! error and an empty folder are indistinguishable on a CDJ's screen, so the
//! cost of a refusal is unbounded and the cost of an empty acknowledgement is
//! one blank list. Three undocumented requests are answered explicitly —
//! `0x3e03` with the `0x4b02` a real player sends, `0x3100` and `0x3d03` with a
//! bare `SUCCESS` — and **everything else this module does not understand is
//! answered `SUCCESS[type, 0]`**, which is a shape real hardware also uses and
//! is never a refusal.
//!
//! # Starting one
