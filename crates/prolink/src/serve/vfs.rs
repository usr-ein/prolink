//! The read-only tree an NFS server hands out.
//!
//! Whatever backs it — a mounted USB stick, or a synthesised `/PIONEER/` layout
//! generated from some other library — the wire layer above should not have to
//! change, so it talks only to this.
//!
//! # Filehandles, and the one place a CDJ breaks the spec
//!
//! RFC 1094 says a filehandle is 32 *opaque* bytes that the client echoes back
//! verbatim. **A CDJ-2000NXS does not.** Handed a handle, it returns one whose
//! first twelve bytes match ours and whose remaining twenty it has rewritten
//! with its own file reference:
//!
//! ```text
//! served:   8a5edab282632443219e051e 4ade2d1d5bbc671c781051bf1437897cbdfea0f1
//! returned: 8a5edab282632443219e051e 03012d0000001b58000000000303010000000162
//!           |____ first 12 kept ____| |______ replaced by the player _______|
//! ```
//!
//! That fits the shape of a real player's own handles — a four-byte value
//! repeated three times followed by zeros — so the leading twelve bytes are
//! evidently the volume identity and the rest is the player's own file
//! reference, which it feels free to overwrite.
//!
//! A server that trusts the spec works perfectly for browsing and fails at
//! exactly the moment a DJ loads a track (F28). This table is therefore keyed on
//! [`FileHandleKey`], which is that twelve-byte prefix and a distinct type, so
//! "I looked the handle up correctly" is a property of the type rather than of
//! remembering to slice.
//!
//! # Two media need two subtrees
//!
//! A handle is a hash of its path. Two media sharing a root would mint identical
//! handles for the same relative path — the root most obviously — and after
//! truncation nothing would distinguish them. So each medium is grafted under
//! its own prefix, and [`Vfs::mount`] takes one.
//!
//! # Unicode, and why an exact match is not enough
//!
//! A name can reach us spelled differently from how the filesystem spells it,
//! and the two must still match.
//!
//! A rekordbox medium is **FAT32** — case-insensitive, case-preserving — and
//! `export.pdb` does not necessarily record a directory entry's case: on the
//! reference stick the database says `Gesaffelstein` where the directory is
//! `GESAFFELSTEIN`. The pdb also stores **NFC** where the filesystem reports
//! **NFD** (`カガミ`), because rekordbox wrote the two through different APIs.
//!
//! A player looking up the path the database gave it therefore asks for a name
//! that, byte for byte, is not the one in our listing, and an exact comparison
//! answers `NFSERR_NOENT` for a file that is plainly there. So: match exactly
//! first, fall back to comparing `NFC(name).casefold()`, and **always return the
//! handle for the name as stored** — hashing the requested spelling would mint a
//! handle that is not in the table, and every later use of it would come back
//! `NFSERR_STALE` (O6).
