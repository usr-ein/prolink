//! The three UDP servers a real player reads our files through.
//!
//! A CDJ loading a track off a peer does not download it: it streams, seeking
//! on demand, and the samples arrive over NFSv2 `READ` while the track plays
//! (F18). So this is not a file-transfer service with a browsing feature — it
//! is the audio path, and a stall in it is an audio dropout on someone's deck.
//!
//! Three programs on three UDP ports, over one shared [`Vfs`]:
//!
//! ```text
//! portmapper  100000 v2  UDP   111   NULL, GETPORT, DUMP
//! mountd      100005 v1  UDP 48276   NULL, MNT, UMNT, UMNTALL, DUMP, EXPORT
//! nfsd        100003 v2  UDP  2049   NULL, GETATTR, LOOKUP, READ, READDIR, STATFS
//! ```
//!
//! # Port 111 is the gate on everything, and it is privileged
//!
//! With nothing on UDP/111 a deck sends `GETPORT` once a second for as long as
//! you care to watch — 31 attempts in `S24c-e9-noportmap`, no sign of giving
//! up — and **never tries 48276 or 2049**, though both were bound and idle. It
//! never opens the dbserver port query on 12523, never opens dbserver, and so
//! never lists us at all (F46).
//!
//! That failure does not look like a file-access failure. It looks like "we do
//! not appear on LINK", and the entire browse path is downstream of it. So the
//! portmapper is bound **last** — after the two ports that cannot fail for want
//! of privilege — and failing to bind it is [`Error::PrivilegedPort`], an error
//! carrying what a user can do about it on this platform, rather than a warning
//! in a log nobody reads. Linux can be told
//! `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=111`; macOS cannot serve 111 without
//! elevation at all.
//!
//! Asking for a portmapper anywhere else — which is what a `portmap_port` other
//! than 111 means — is allowed, because it is how the fallback question was
//! settled experimentally, and it warns at startup. [`Ports::is_discoverable`]
//! is what a caller should check before believing it is browsable.
//!
//! # mountd's port is a constant that is still discovered
//!
//! 48276 is not registered to anything, but three independent observations
//! across three devices gave the same number (F6), so it looks like a Pioneer
//! constant. We take it when it is free and publish it through the portmapper
//! anyway, because that is how a deck actually finds it. Losing it to some
//! other program on the host costs only the client that skips discovery;
//! failing to bind at all would cost everything, so mountd and nfsd both fall
//! back to an ephemeral port and the portmapper publishes whatever they got.
//!
//! # What a datagram costs
//!
//! Each call is answered on its own task, and the answer is computed on a
//! blocking thread, because a `READ` of a file on a USB stick is a disk seek.
//! Doing that inline would park a runtime worker mid-`recv`, and the same
//! runtime is emitting the 200 ms status packets that keep us on the network.
//! Concurrency is capped at [`MAX_IN_FLIGHT`]: past that a datagram is dropped
//! rather than queued, which on UDP is a retransmit and not a failure.
//!
//! A load is around 20 `LOOKUP`s and 201 `READ`s, and playback seeks all over
//! the file, so the shape that matters is many small random reads at low
//! latency rather than throughput.
//!
//! # Everything else worth knowing
//!
//! is in `nfs/answer.rs`, which turns one call into one reply and is where the
//! module documentation covers the filehandle a CDJ truncates (F28), why there
//! is no duplicate-request cache, why the export list is the tree itself, and
//! which attributes we send.
