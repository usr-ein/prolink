//! The browse surface: every list a deck can reach behind the LINK button.
//!
//! One function, [`build`], turns a menu request into the rows it should
//! produce. Nothing here does I/O and nothing here holds state; the result set
//! it returns is what the connection remembers and pages through.
//!
//! # An error and an empty folder look the same on a deck
//!
//! So the set of requests answered here is a **user-visible surface** rather
//! than an internal detail (F40), and it is settled by what a real CDJ-2000NXS
//! actually asks for. Every request type in `S20-browse-ground-truth`,
//! `S18-two-slots`, `S19`, `S22` and `S23` is answered: the eleven root
//! categories we serve, the thirteen drill types the grid generates, all twelve
//! sorts, search, metadata and track info.
//!
//! `FOLDER` is the one root category deliberately omitted. It browses
//! *unanalysed* files by directory with a track-type-2 descriptor, and a
//! rekordbox export does not describe that tree — offering a category we would
//! answer empty is worse than not offering it.
//!
//! # Four places the reference implementation was wrong
//!
//! Each was settled by reading a real deck's replies out of the corpus rather
//! than by reasoning:
//!
//! - **The DEFAULT sort of a track list is by title.** The reference used the
//!   library's artist-then-title order. A real deck answering `MENU_TRACK` with
//!   sort 0 returns `Acidité, Acid Lunch, Acid Storm, ACXD, Add Some More` —
//!   title order, whatever the artist. Inside a playlist DEFAULT still means
//!   the curated order, which is what a playlist is for.
//! - **Argument 9 of a track row is a position and it is not always zero.**
//!   In a plain list it is the track's number within its album (`ACXD` came
//!   back as 23); inside a playlist or a history list it is the 1-based
//!   position in that list.
//! - **Search returns three kinds of row, not tracks.** Matching artists
//!   first, then albums, then tracks, with argument 0 carrying `1`, `2` and `3`
//!   respectively — which is how the deck knows to answer a click on one of
//!   them with an ARTIST drill rather than a load.
//! - **The BITRATE listing is descending.** 2116, 320, 256, 224, 192, 160 off
//!   a real deck; the reference sorted ascending.
//!
//! # A category lists the rows a track references, not the table
//!
//! A rekordbox medium carries artist rows nothing points at — they survive a
//! track being removed, and they arrive through `original_artist_id`,
//! `remixer_id` and `composer_id`, which no track list browses by. Listing the
//! whole table puts them in the ARTIST menu where each opens onto nothing.
//! Confirmed against hardware: in `S20` one CDJ-2000NXS asked another for the
//! ARTIST menu of a medium whose table holds 329 rows and was answered **290**,
//! exactly the number a track references.
