//! Announcing ourselves as a player: the claim chain, the keep-alive and the
//! status stream.
//!
//! This is the **only** part of the library that transmits on a Pro DJ Link
//! port, which is what makes everything else passive by construction.
//!
//! # Two modes, and the difference is not cosmetic
//!
//! [`Numbering::Observer`] emits keep-alives at a number outside the player
//! range and never contends for anything. It is enough to be *seen*, and enough
//! for peers to start unicasting status to us — which is what makes their slot
//! contents and the tempo master visible at all. It is **not** enough to be
//! browsed, and it cannot issue dbserver queries.
//!
//! [`Numbering::Claim`] runs the full handshake and takes a real player slot in
//! 1–4. Necessary to be browsable, and the only mode that can disturb a live
//! rig, so it is opt-in, it refuses a number it has seen anyone else use, and it
//! backs off on conflict.
//!
//! The range is a requirement rather than a preference. At device 5 a deck
//! accepts the announcement completely — it puts us in its device table and
//! unicasts hundreds of status packets to us — and then never sends a single
//! media query, so it never offers us as a source. The check precedes the whole
//! browse path and the failure is silent (F45). [`BrowsableDeviceNumber`] exists
//! so that this cannot be configured by accident.
//!
//! # The handshake
//!
//! ```text
//! 3× hello → 3× claim_mac → 3× claim_ip → N× claim_number → keep_alive forever
//! ```
//!
//! All broadcast, ~300 ms apart. **N is 3 when the device boots into an empty
//! network and 1 when it joins one that already has peers** (C13) — it is not
//! governed by the auto/manual assignment setting, which three controlled boots
//! with the setting held constant settle.
//!
//! Before any of that, we watch for [`PRESCAN`]. Silence is not evidence a
//! number is free: an XDJ-XZ and an Opus Quad do not defend their numbers with
//! conflict packets at all, so only having watched the network is.
