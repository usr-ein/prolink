//! Reading a player's media: the ONC RPC, MOUNT and NFSv2 client.
//!
//! This is the passive half of consuming. A CDJ exports its SD card and its USB
//! stick to the whole link-local subnet (`169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0`), so a host
//! that has never announced itself is inside the permitted set by default (F11,
//! F12) and can pull `export.pdb` and every audio file behind it without
//! touching UDP 50000 at all.
//!
//! ```text
//! GETPORT(mountd) ─► GETPORT(nfsd) ─► MNT '/C/' ─► LOOKUP × n ─► READ × n ─► UMNT
//!   udp/111           udp/111          udp/48276     udp/2049     udp/2049
//! ```
//!
//! # Ports are discovered even though they never move
//!
//! mountd answers on **48276** and nfsd on **2049** on every device anyone has
//! looked at — three independent observations across three devices (F6). They
//! are still discovered rather than assumed, because 48276 is not a registered
//! number and because a `GETPORT` costs one datagram. When a program is *not*
//! registered, a bare `GETPORT` cannot tell "this device runs no RPC at all"
//! from "it runs RPC and exports nothing", so a failed lookup falls back to a
//! `DUMP` and the error says which of the two it was. Both ports are resolved
//! once, at connect: the C++ port re-resolved them on every mount and paid two
//! extra round trips per medium for it.
//!
//! # A retransmission reuses its xid, deliberately
//!
//! This runs over UDP, so a lost datagram is a normal event and a dead peer
//! must time out rather than hang. Every call is retried
//! [`NfsConfig::attempts`] times with the **same** xid — RFC 1057's own advice,
//! and the reason is that a late first reply and the retry's reply are then
//! recognisable as duplicates of one another rather than as two answers. A
//! reply carrying any other xid is discarded and the wait continues, because it
//! answers a call we have already given up on and decoding it here would read
//! one procedure's results as another's.
//!
//! The reference implementation measured **842 `READ`s with 0 retries at 1459
//! KiB/s** pulling a 1 MB `export.pdb`, so on a quiet link the retry path is
//! dead code — which is exactly why it is tested deliberately rather than left
//! to be exercised in the field.
//!
//! # One call in flight, and why that is not the slow choice it looks like
//!
//! Both reference clients pipeline four reads at once. This one does not, and
//! the arithmetic is the reason: their 1459 KiB/s came from a window of four
//! **1280-byte** reads, and a single **8192-byte** read moves 6.4× the payload
//! per round trip. Sequential-at-8192 therefore beats windowed-at-1280 on the
//! same link, while keeping the retry rule small enough to be obviously
//! correct. Windowing on top of 8192 would multiply again and is untried here;
//! it is the first thing to reach for if a 75 MB track ever feels slow.
//!
//! # Read size is the one real tuning decision
//!
//! Real CDJs ask for **8192** bytes, the NFSv2 maximum, and rely on IP
//! fragmentation: the reply is one ~8.3 KB datagram in six fragments on a
//! 1500-byte MTU, and losing any one of them loses the whole read (F19).
//! [`ReadSize::UNFRAGMENTED`] is 1280, which fits a single frame — safe, and
//! **6.4× more round trips** for the same bytes. The default here is
//! [`ReadSize::CDJ`], because the point of this library is to behave like the
//! hardware and because a link that cannot reassemble fragments will also fail
//! the first `READ` a real deck makes. Switch to 1280 when a network is
//! dropping fragments; nothing else about the client changes.
//!
//! A short read is normal and means "ask for the shortfall", never "the file
//! ended". Nothing in a `READ` reply says where the end is: a real CDJ sends a
//! `fattr` that is **entirely zero apart from `fileid`** in 7884 of 7884 replies
//! (see [`nfs2::FileData::attr`]), so `size == 0` there is not end of file and a
//! client that believed it would truncate every transfer. The size comes from
//! the `LOOKUP` or `GETATTR` that opened the file, which is why [`RemoteFile`]
//! exists and carries it.
//!
//! # Directory handles are cached because a player's handle table is finite
//!
//! The single most expensive lesson in the reference port. A CDJ keeps a
//! bounded table of the handles it has issued and starts answering
//! `NFSERR_STALE` once that table churns: re-walking `PIONEER/Artwork/000NN`
//! from the root for every cover minted roughly **2300 handles** across one
//! medium and **495 of 576 fetches failed**, all on the last lookup of the
//! path. A real CDJ uses **four** distinct directory handles across
//! forty-eight lookups, because it remembers the directory it is in. So does
//! [`NfsClient`]: every directory a walk passes through is cached per mount, so
//! a path whose folder is already known costs **one** `LOOKUP` instead of four,
//! and a leaf that misses drops that cached folder and re-walks from the root
//! exactly once — so a file that is genuinely gone fails rather than looping.
//! Where that still is not enough — the medium was swapped — the answer is
//! [`ErrorStatus::STALE`], and [`NfsClient::refresh`] is how to recover.
//!
//! # Filehandles travel back verbatim
//!
//! A CDJ keeps only the leading twelve bytes of a handle it was served and
//! overwrites the rest (F28) — that is a *server's* problem. As a client the
//! rule is the plain one: echo back exactly the 32 bytes the peer gave, never
//! parse or normalise them.
//!
//! # `NFSERR_ACCES` on `MNT` means "announce first", not "give up"
//!
//! One device in a published capture scoped its export to two per-host entries
//! rather than to the whole subnet. Against that device an unannounced client
//! is refused, and the remedy is [`crate::VirtualCdj`] rather than an error to
//! the user (F12). The `EXPORT` listing names the permitted hosts, so it also
//! diagnoses the refusal.
//!
//! # Names are spelled differently in the database and on the medium
//!
//! `export.pdb` says `Gesaffelstein` where the directory is `GESAFFELSTEIN`,
//! and it stores NFC where a FAT32 driver reports NFD (`カガミ`). A server
//! comparing bytes answers `NFSERR_NOENT` for a file that is plainly there;
//! `crate::serve::vfs` documents that side. As a *client* we cannot list a
//! directory to find out — a real deck answers `READDIR` with `PROC_UNAVAIL` —
//! so [`NfsClient::walk`] retries a `NOENT` component through the handful of
//! spellings the two sides are known to disagree on, and gives up with the
//! status the peer actually sent.
