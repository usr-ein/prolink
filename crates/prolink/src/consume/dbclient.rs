//! Browsing a player's library: the dbserver client.
//!
//! What the LINK button drives, from the other end. NFS makes a medium's files
//! *readable*; this makes it *browsable*, and the two are independent — a peer
//! whose every byte we can read will still show nothing without this. It is
//! also the only way to get album art out of a player: a real CDJ never asks
//! NFS for an image.
//!
//! ```text
//! TCP 12523  ─►  19 bytes out, 2 back: which port?
//! TCP 1051   ─►  preamble ─► INTRODUCE ─► SUCCESS[0, their device number]
//!                MENU_*   ─► SUCCESS[type, item count]
//!                RENDER   ─► MENU_HEADER, n× MENU_ITEM, MENU_FOOTER
//!                MENU_CLOSE (no reply)
//! ```
//!
//! # Announcing is a precondition, so it is a precondition of the type
//!
//! The descriptor that opens nearly every request carries **our** device
//! number, and a player validates it: it must be in 1–4 and it must belong to
//! a device actually on the network. [`DbClient::connect`] therefore takes a
//! [`BrowsableDeviceNumber`], which only [`crate::VirtualCdj`] running
//! [`crate::virtual_cdj::Numbering::Claim`] can produce. The observer number a
//! passive listener takes cannot be borrowed for a session here, and that is a
//! compile error rather than a puzzling refusal at run time (F45).
//!
//! # One request in flight, always
//!
//! The stream carries **no length framing** — a message is delimited by nothing
//! but its own contents — so a second request in flight would be answered with
//! no way to tell which answer belonged to which. Worse, a reply that arrives
//! after we have stopped waiting for it is parsed as the *next* request's reply
//! and every answer after that is one out, silently. So requests are strictly
//! serialised, a reply under an unexpected transaction id marks the connection
//! desynchronised, and a desynchronised connection is finished: there is no
//! frame boundary to resynchronise on.
//!
//! # `0x0001` draws no reply at all
//!
//! `MENU_CLOSE` is the one message with no answer — 23 sends in one
//! CDJ-to-CDJ browse, and the packet accounting in that capture leaves nothing
//! over for a response (F16). A client that waits for one hangs until its
//! timeout. It reuses the transaction id of the `RENDER_MENU` it follows, which
//! is why [`DbClient::menu`] keeps the last render's id rather than allocating
//! a fresh one.
//!
//! # Two counts, and only one of them is the page size
//!
//! A menu request is answered with `SUCCESS [type, count]`, and every
//! `RENDER_MENU` that pages it echoes that **whole-result-set count**, not the
//! page size. That is not cosmetic: a server keys its pending result sets on
//! `(descriptor, count)` because a deck interleaves a metadata lookup with a
//! 692-item track list and then resumes the list at the next offset without
//! re-issuing its request (F27, F41). Sending the page size instead names a
//! result set nobody has.
//!
//! A count of [`NOT_FOUND`] means exactly that, and an empty menu is not an
//! error: on a CDJ's screen an error and an empty folder look identical, so the
//! two are kept apart here deliberately.
//!
//! # Transaction ids start at `0x03800001`
//!
//! Not at 1, whatever the pre-hardware literature says (C10). The value is
//! opaque and a server only echoes it, so nothing breaks either way — but a
//! client counting from 1 is one more way to look unlike a CDJ.
//!
//! # What this client does *not* send
//!
//! `0x3e03`, the undocumented request a player fires immediately after
//! `INTRODUCE` when the thing it is browsing is a **foreign** device. It never
//! appears between two CDJs, and against a real player we are the client, so
//! sending it would be a message no deck ever sends. `crate::serve::dbserver`
//! has to *answer* it, which is the other half of the same finding (F25).
//!
//! # Strings here are the opposite of strings over NFS
//!
//! UTF-16 **big**-endian, counted in **characters including a trailing NUL**;
//! the NFS half is UTF-16 little-endian counted in bytes. Two endiannesses and
//! two units in one protocol. Nothing is shared between the two encoders and
//! nothing should be — [`prolink_proto::dbserver::encode_string`] here,
//! `prolink_proto::rpc::xdr` there.
//!
//! # The path a track load needs comes from here
//!
//! [`DbClient::track_info`] returns a path like
//! `/Contents/Tomcraft/Loneliness/… .mp3`, already relative to the mount root,
//! which is exactly what [`crate::consume::NfsClient::open`] takes. **Argument
//! 0 of that path item is the file size** — zero on every other menu item ever
//! captured, which is precisely why it reads as structural padding, and it is
//! the one thing a load needs that browsing does not (F31).
