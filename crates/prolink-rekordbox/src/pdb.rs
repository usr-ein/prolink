//! `export.pdb` — the DeviceSQL database rekordbox writes to a medium.
//!
//! A fixed-page store: 4096-byte pages, one chain of pages per table, rows
//! written forward from the page header while their offsets live in a **reverse
//! index** growing backwards from the end of the page. Everything is
//! little-endian, which is the opposite of the ANLZ files it points at.
//!
//! Random access is required throughout — page indices are absolute and rows
//! point at their own strings by relative offset — so the whole file has to be
//! resident. [`Pdb`] therefore borrows a slice rather than reading a stream.
//!
//! # The awkward parts, all of which are real and all of which bite
//!
//! **The reverse index is doubly reversed.** Row offsets live in groups of 16
//! at the end of the page, each group 36 bytes: 32 bytes of offsets, a 16-bit
//! presence bitmask, and two more bytes. Within a group the offsets run
//! backwards, so row 0 occupies the *last* slot.
//!
//! **The presence bitmask outranks the header's row count (F47).** The
//! published analysis says live rows "have to be bounded by the page's entry
//! count, not by the bitmask alone". On a real medium a playlist-entries page
//! carried `num_rows = 39` while its three group masks marked 16 + 16 + 8 = 40
//! rows live, and the fortieth was a genuine track the deck itself lists.
//! Capping the walk at the count drops trailing rows whenever the two disagree,
//! and always from the *end*, which is the least conspicuous place. It survived
//! a whole project phase undetected and surfaced only when a second,
//! independent parser was pointed at the same bytes and returned 40 where the
//! first returned 39. The group *count* is still derived from the header, which
//! bounds the walk; the mask then decides which of those slots are live.
//!
//! **The row count is in one of two fields.** `num_rows_large` wins when it
//! exceeds `num_rows_small`, except when it is the sentinel `0x1fff` and except
//! on "strange" pages. Artwork and playlist-map pages are the ones that need
//! the large field.
//!
//! **Every table chain starts with a "strange" page** — flag `0x40` — that
//! holds no rows and only links onward.
//!
//! # The header's sequence counter is volatile (F13)
//!
//! Pulling a 1,077,248-byte `export.pdb` off a deck over NFS and then reading
//! the same file off the ejected stick produced two files whose SHA-256s
//! differ. They differ in **exactly two fields**, both in the file header, and
//! nowhere else in a megabyte: `unknown1` at `0x10` (4 → 5) and the global
//! write counter `sequence` at `0x14` (20585 → 20586). The deck wrote to its
//! own database between the reads — a play count, a history entry — and the
//! library content was bit-identical.
//!
//! So any cache keyed on a whole-file hash invalidates spuriously and
//! re-downloads a library that has not changed by one track. Use
//! [`stable_digest`], which zeroes [`VOLATILE_HEADER`] first.
