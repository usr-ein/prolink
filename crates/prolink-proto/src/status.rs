//! Player status, media queries and device settings — UDP 50002, unicast.
//!
//! The half of Pro DJ Link that is **invisible until you announce**. A player
//! unicasts on 50002 to peers that have announced themselves and to nobody
//! else: all 1507 status packets in one session went deck-to-deck, and not one
//! reached a host that had been on the network the whole time without
//! announcing (F21).
//!
//! That single fact decides the shape of the whole library. Slot occupancy is
//! published here and *nowhere else* (F20), so a virtual CDJ is a hard
//! prerequisite both for browsing a deck and for being browsed by one — and a
//! device that does not emit status is a device with empty slots however loudly
//! it announces.
//!
//! # The header is not the one on port 50000
//!
//! The device name occupies `0x0b`–`0x1e` — one byte earlier and one byte
//! shorter than on the discovery port — and byte `0x1f` is a structural `0x01`
//! where the discovery header has its name's last byte (C14). The type byte at
//! `0x0a` is *shared* between the two ports and the layouts behind it are not:
//! `0x06` is a keep-alive on 50000 and a media response here. Reusing
//! [`crate::djl`]'s decoder yields plausible nonsense rather than an error.
//!
//! ```text
//! 0x00-0x09  magic "Qspt1WmJOL"
//! 0x0a       packet kind
//! 0x0b-0x1e  device name        20 bytes ASCII, NUL-padded
//! 0x1f       structural 0x01
//! 0x20       subtype
//! 0x21       sender device number
//! 0x22-0x23  body length        bytes following 0x24
//! 0x24…      body
//! ```
//!
//! # What is a field and what is a template
//!
//! [`MediaQuery`] and [`SettingsQuery`] are short and fully understood, so they
//! are ordinary structs. [`CdjStatus`], [`MediaResponse`] and
//! [`SettingsResponse`] are not: a status packet is 284 bytes of which about a
//! dozen can be named. Those three own their datagram and expose the fields we
//! understand as accessors — which is honest about the ~260 bytes we do not,
//! and is what lets an emitted packet be byte-diffed against a real one.
//!
//! Their constructors establish, once, that the buffer carries the magic, the
//! right kind byte and enough length for every field the accessors read. The
//! accessors are therefore total. Fields past that guaranteed prefix return
//! [`Option`], because a short packet from older hardware genuinely does not
//! contain them.
