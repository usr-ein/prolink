//! The metadata protocol the LINK button drives — TCP 1051, "remotedb".
//!
//! Everything a CDJ shows about another player's media travels here: the root
//! categories, every list behind them, a track's metadata, its file path and
//! size, and its artwork. NFS makes a medium's *files* readable; this makes the
//! medium *browsable*, and the two are independent — a deck that can read every
//! byte over NFS will still show an empty menu if this is missing or wrong.
//!
//! Written from `docs/PROTOCOL.md` §5 and validated against **11 809 messages**
//! reassembled from every dbserver stream in the capture corpus — 30 streams
//! across 45 sessions plus dysentery's two `LinkInfo` files. Every stream is
//! framed by this decoder alone and consumed end to end with nothing left over,
//! and every message re-encodes byte for byte (F7). Framing the whole stream is
//! the check that matters, because a single misstep on the omitted-blob rule
//! below desynchronises everything after it silently.
//!
//! # Finding the port, and the preamble
//!
//! The port is nominally dynamic. A client asks TCP [`PORT_QUERY_PORT`] with
//! the fixed 19-byte [`PORT_QUERY`] and gets a two-byte big-endian answer; both
//! reference captures answer [`PORT`], as does every deck we have seen, but the
//! query is cheap and skipping it is one more way to look unlike a CDJ.
//!
//! Then, **in both directions and before any message**, each peer sends the
//! five-byte [`PREAMBLE`] — a bare `UInt32` field holding 1. A stream decoder
//! that goes looking for the first magic without stepping over it fails on the
//! first byte, so [`skip_preamble`] exists and is not optional.
//!
//! # Framing, and why truncation is not an error
//!
//! ```text
//! 11 87 23 49 ae   magic, itself a tagged UInt32
//! 11 xx xx xx xx   transaction id
//! 10 xx xx         message type
//! 0f xx            argument count, at most 12
//! 14 00 00 00 0c   the 12-byte argument-tag blob
//! …                the arguments
//! ```
//!
//! A message carries **no length prefix**. It is framed by nothing but its own
//! contents, so the only way to know whether a TCP buffer holds a whole one is
//! to try, and running off the end is the *expected* outcome of trying too
//! early. [`Message::decode`] reports how many bytes it consumed, and
//! [`Error::is_truncated`] is what separates "wait for more" from "this peer is
//! not speaking the protocol" — the second of which has no recovery, because
//! there is no frame boundary to resynchronise on.
//!
//! # Three things that are easy to get wrong
//!
//! **Two independent type numberings.** Every value on the wire is a tagged
//! field ([`FieldTag`]: `0f`/`10`/`11`/`14`/`26`) and the header *also* carries
//! a twelve-byte blob of *argument* tags ([`ArgTag`]: `02`/`03`/`06`)
//! describing the same arguments with entirely different numbers. Both must
//! agree. Here they cannot disagree: a [`Field`] yields both, from one match on
//! one enum, and the header blob is derived at encode time rather than stored.
//!
//! **A zero-length binary argument is absent from the wire.** Not sent as an
//! empty blob: gone, with the preceding `UInt32` length argument as the only
//! evidence it was ever declared. This is the rule that silently
//! desynchronises a naive parser — the reader consumes the next message's magic
//! as a field and every argument after that is one position out, with no error
//! to show for it — and it is the *common* case rather than an exotic one: a
//! player answers `GetArtwork` for a track with no art exactly this way.
//! Encoding is the exact inverse of decoding here, so a message omits an
//! argument if and only if a decoder would infer its absence.
//!
//! **Strings count characters, not bytes.** The prefix is the UTF-16 length
//! *including a terminating NUL*, so a three-character string announces 4 and
//! carries 8 bytes, and the text is UTF-16 **big**-endian. The NFS half of the
//! same protocol sends UTF-16 **little**-endian counted in **bytes**. The two
//! conventions are opposites in both axes and must never share a helper:
//! [`encode_string`] here, [`crate::rpc::xdr`] there. Within one menu item both
//! units appear at once — arguments 2 and 4 are label lengths in *bytes* while
//! the string fields beside them are counted in *characters* — which is why
//! [`string_characters`] and [`label_bytes`] are separately named functions and
//! why [`MenuItem`] derives both rather than letting a caller supply them.
//!
//! # Why this is hand-rolled and not `binrw`
//!
//! `ksy/prolink_dbserver.ksy` shows the read direction expresses fine
//! declaratively. The write direction does not: the argument-tag blob is a
//! summary of the arguments that follow, and whether an argument appears at all
//! depends on the *value* of the argument before it. Expressed in `binrw` those
//! two rules would have to be written once for reading and again for writing,
//! and duplicating the omitted-blob rule is precisely the bug it causes. A
//! cursor over `&[u8]` states each rule once, in code both directions call, and
//! gives the consumed-byte count a stream reader needs for free.
//!
//! # Vocabulary
//!
//! The second half of this module is the protocol's *nouns*: message types,
//! item types, the root categories, sort orders and the menu-item layout. They
//! are tables of observed values wherever the evidence allows only a table.
//! Five bugs in the reference implementation came from deriving a value that
//! looked derivable (F26, F40, F27/F41, F31/F35), so a derivation here is used
//! only where the *whole grid* has been observed — [`drill_kind`] — and the
//! root categories, which two separate derivations got wrong in two different
//! places, are simply listed (F43).
