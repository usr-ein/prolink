//! ONC RPC v2, the portmapper, MOUNT and NFSv2 — UDP 111, 48276 and 2049.
//!
//! This is how audio actually moves. A CDJ serves the contents of its SD card
//! and USB stick over NFS version 2, and a deck loading a track off a peer
//! reads the audio file itself — progressively, seeking on demand, ~38% of a
//! 7.6 MB MP3 touched during one load plus thirty seconds of playback (F18).
//! dbserver supplies metadata, waveforms and cues; the samples come over
//! `READ`. Nothing in the pre-hardware literature states this.
//!
//! Everything here works in both directions. We are a client — mounting a
//! player's export, walking to a file one `LOOKUP` per component, streaming
//! reads — and we are a server, because a real deck will play from us if we
//! answer the same calls. Each procedure therefore has all four halves: build
//! a call, parse a call, build a reply, parse a reply.
//!
//! ```text
//! rpc          RPC v2 framing: the call and reply headers, AUTH_UNIX
//! rpc::xdr     XDR, and Pioneer's UTF-16LE deviation from it
//! rpc::portmap program 100000 v2, UDP 111   — GETPORT, DUMP
//! rpc::mount   program 100005 v1, UDP 48276 — MNT, UMNT, EXPORT
//! rpc::nfs2    program 100003 v2, UDP 2049  — LOOKUP, READ, GETATTR, …
//! ```
//!
//! # Five things that are easy to get wrong
//!
//! **Names are UTF-16 little-endian, counted in bytes.** Not the ASCII that
//! standard NFS uses. See [`xdr`], which explains it at length; it is the
//! single most important non-standard fact about this path, and it is why a
//! stock NFS library is no use.
//!
//! **The `AUTH_UNIX` stamp is neither a magic constant nor a nonce.** It is a
//! fixed sequence indexed by the number of RPC calls a device has made since
//! power-on, identical across devices and across a decade of firmware — the
//! same xid always carries the same stamp, in 9947 recurrences across separate
//! captures with no exceptions. That supersedes both published readings; see
//! [`AuthUnix::stamp`] and [`STAMP_SEQUENCE`]. The rest of the credential is
//! exactly as documented — `machine_name=""`, `uid=0`, `gid=0`, no
//! supplementary gids, in 56,966 of 56,966 calls.
//!
//! **A portmapper on UDP/111 is mandatory to be browsable at all.** With
//! nothing on 111, a deck retries `GETPORT` once a second indefinitely, never
//! falls back to the well-known 48276 and 2049 even when both are bound and
//! idle, never opens the dbserver port query on 12523, and so never lists us
//! (F46). The observed order of a real load is the reverse of what the
//! literature implies:
//!
//! ```text
//! media query 0x05 ─► portmap GETPORT ─► MNT ─► 12523 ─► dbserver ─► READ
//!      t=7.6s              t=44.09s              t=44.11s          t=52s
//! ```
//!
//! **A CDJ does not treat the filehandle as opaque.** RFC 1094 says 32 bytes
//! echoed back verbatim; a CDJ-2000NXS keeps the leading twelve and overwrites
//! the rest with its own file reference (F28). A server that trusts the spec
//! browses perfectly and fails at the moment a DJ loads a track. See
//! [`FileHandle`] and [`FileHandleKey`].
//!
//! **Offsets and sizes are 32-bit**, so NFSv2 cannot address past 4 GiB. The
//! ceiling is asserted rather than silently wrapped — see
//! [`nfs2::checked_offset`].
//!
//! # Credentials are parsed, not enforced
//!
//! A player exports its media to the whole link-local subnet
//! (`169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0`), which is why a host that has never announced
//! itself can still read a deck's files (F11, F12). Our server decodes
//! credentials for the record and acts on none of them: being stricter than
//! the hardware we are impersonating could only make us the reason a real deck
//! fails.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! The call direction was validated against 8415 real calls through the Kaitai
//! schema `ksy/prolink_rpc.ksy`; the reply direction against two CDJ-2000NXS
//! running firmware 1.44 across the `S10*` and `S24*` serve sessions.
